# SACK Protocol
Implementation of SACK (Selective Acknowledgement) file transfer protocol: a hybrid version of two pipelined reliable data transfer protocols, Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat.

In SACK Protocol, there are two types of acknowledgment information simultaneously: **cumulative ACK** and **selective ACK**.
With different ACKs, the receiver can cache and selectively acknowledge out-of-order segments, and the sender, knowing that some of those segments have been selectively acknowledged, can utilize the bandwidth to retransmit other segments that havenâ€™t been selectively acknowledged.
The original Go-Back-N mechanism can also be used to cumulatively acknowledge multiple segments.

## Congestion Control
Also, a congestion control scheme is implemented in the transmission, illustrated in the following finite state machine.

The idea of this protocol originated from an option of TCP's error-recovery mechanism defined in [RFC2018](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2018). For full details of the protocol, please refer to [The Spec Sheet](https://github.com/yc-LoAndy/SACK-Data-Transfer-Protocol/blob/main/CN2023-HW3-ProblemSheet_1201.pdf).
